## Admin in a day

# Dataverse for Teams

#### Hands-on lab

## Lab Scenario

In this hands-on lab you will create a Power App in a team and see how to publish it to your team. You
will also share with colleagues outside your team to see how broad distribution apps work.

## Lab Test Environment

This hands-on lab is designed to be completed in an environment setup for multiple students to complete
the Admin in a day series of hands-on labs.

You will be assigned one or more users to use to complete the tasks. Because this is a shared
environment, some tasks that require a tenant Global Administrator or a Service Administrator will already
be completed. Your account will only be an environment administrator.
